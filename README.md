## Overview of the analysis
The goal of this analysis is to create a basic statistical analysis of the temperatures in Oahu in June and December. In order to determine the sustainability  of the surf and ice cream shop during all year-round, a query is made to collect weather information such as average, max, and min temperatures.

## Results
### June
Referring to the following screenshot of June weather statistics.

![June Weather Statistics](https://github.com/Oysterrr/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/Jun%20Temp%20Summary%20Stats.PNG)

There are total of 1,700 observations in June from year 2010 to 2017. The low standard deviation implies a small spread among the observations. As a result, the weather in Oahu does not fluctuate a lot in June.

### December
Referring to the following screenshot of June weather statistics.

![December Weather Statistics](https://github.com/Oysterrr/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/Dec%20Temp%20Summary%20Stats.PNG)

There are total of 1,517 observations in December from year 2010 to 2017, where the less observations indicte there are some missing data. The weather in December is actually similar to the weather in June also with a small spread because of the the low standard deviation. The weather in Oahu does not fluctuate a lot in December like as in June.

## Summary
After the comparison between the weather data between June and December, we can conclude that the weather in Oahu is relativaly similar all year-round. In order to make a better decision for the ice cream shop business sustainability, two more queries should be considered:
### In addition to simiply observing the temperatures in two months, a query to analyze the frequency of rain, snow, etc. might also imply the weather's impact on the business.
### A query to compare the weather in two locations would also help to determine the location selection for the business.
